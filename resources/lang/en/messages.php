            How Does Face Recognition Time Attendance App Work?

        'faq_a_1'           =>  "
            Many people are familiar with this technology through FaceID owned by the iPhone.
            Actually, facial recognition technology does not require a database of someone's photos to recognize someone's identity.
            It works as simply as recognizing one person as the owner of the device and will not
            give access to someone other than the owner. Here's more about how facial recognition works.

            Computer software uses an algorithm to generate a unique template (map) of a face.
            The software then compares that template against templates of other faces contained in a
            database, typically resulting in a group of facial images ranked according to computer evaluated
            similarity

            Most technologies with facial recognition systems will rely on two-dimensional images as opposed to three-dimensional because it can easily match two-dimensional images with existing photos in the database.

            Some aspects that will be analyzed include the distance between the eyes, the depth of the eyes, the distance between the forehead and the chin, the shape of the jaw, as well as the contours of the lips, ears, and chin.

            These aspects will be the key determinants to assess the suitability of your face.

            Facial recognition should not be used to breach an individual’s rights,
            particularly their right to privacy, or to make independent decisions in events that
            involve human interpretation. Create intent boundaries for the use of facial recognition data.
            Data should be processed for particular, intentional, and predefined purposes wherever possible.
            When data is used for purposes other than those specified, ethical concerns often emerge.

            Face recognition software employs computer algorithms to identify unique, distinguishing features on a person’s face.
            These data, such as eye range or jaw shape, are then transformed into a mathematical
            representation and contrasted to data from other faces in a face recognition database.

            Choosing the best biometric protection system has become a big decision for companies of all sizes and industries.

            The use of facial recognition system has the ability to be harmful.
